                <h2>NoSQL Database Primer</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>The first thing to know about the Glass Plates Inventory site is that it uses a noSQL database to store information.  You may be familiar with SQL databases, which can be thought of as a collection of tables or spreadsheets that store a specific set of structured data.  Information in one column of a table might be connected to information in another table, thus creating a relationship between the data in the different tables.  This kind of database is typically very structured, with specific defined fields, and with a specific type of data found in that field.  Adding another field alters the entire table, and if that field is set to be required then all existing entries in the database must be updated to contain content in the new field.
                </p>

                <p/>For example, you may have a database table of DASCH data:</p>
                <div class="doc-img">
                    <p><img style="width: 100%" src="{% static 'website/img/nosql1.png' %}"></p>
                </div>

                <p/>And let’s say you want to collect data from multiple archives into one table:</p>
                <div class="doc-img">
                    <p><img style="width: 100%" src="{% static 'website/img/nosql2.png' %}"></p>
                </div>

                <p/>Some fields, such as the Archive field in column A, contain very uniform information. This column will always contain the name of the Archive the plate is from.  Additionally, there is a known list of archives in the database, so it might make sense to put that information into its own small table that can be called on from the main table.</p>

                <p/>Now the Archive column lists an ID number:</p>
                <div class="doc-img">
                    <p><img style="width: 30%" src="{% static 'website/img/nosql3.png' %}"></p>
                </div>

                <p/>And that ID number is drawn from the Archive Info Table, which can be used to correlate an ID with the archive’s name:</p>
                <div class="doc-img">
                    <p><img style="width: 50%" src="{% static 'website/img/nosql4.png' %}"></p>
                </div>

                <p/>Now, each Archive is named only once in the database and that information is referred to by the plate table.  This is a primary feature of SQL and relational databases.</p>

                <p/>Something else you may notice about the above examples is that we have different information from different archives, for example the WFPDB and Hamburg provide information about emulsions, but DASCH does not.  DASCH and Hamburg provide Right Ascension in the hours, minute, seconds format, but WFPDB provides this information as decimal degrees.</p>

                <p/>Though it is possible for an SQL database to handle a dataset like this, if new content is being added to the database over time, tacking on additional columns to handle the unique data provided by each archive could become overwhelming.  SQL databases are fantastic for collecting data about well defined and uniform content.  But sometimes you need to work with a collection of less defined data, data from a variety of sources, data that might be incomplete.  This is where noSQL databases can shine.</p>

                <p/>In a noSQL database, information is stored as a series of JSON documents.  A JSON document is written in a format similar to a python dictionary, or a JavaScript object (in fact JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation).  A JSON document is made up of a series of key-value pairs written with a specific, yet simple, syntax.</p>

                <p/>For example, to store an identifier about a plate, you could write:</p>

                <pre>{
    "identifier" :  "a1731"
}</pre>

                <p>The value "a1731" is assigned to the key "identifier".</p>

                <p>More information can be added by using a comma to separate each key-value pair, which is sometimes called a dictionary.</p>

                <pre>{
    "identifier" :  "a1731",
    "rightAscension" : "00:07:02.386",
    "declination" : "-89:27:40.89"
}</pre>

                <p>If you had multiple records, you would list sets of dictionaries for each record, like this:</p>

                <pre>{
    "identifier" :  "a1731",
    "rightAscension" : "00:07:02.386",
    "declination" : "-89:27:40.89"
},
{
    "identifier" :  "ac1",
    "rightAscension" : "05:59:51.748",
    "declination" : "+75:29:44.39"
},
{
    "identifier" :  "b853",
    "rightAscension" : "12:09:05.694",
    "declination" : "+88:54:58.55"
}</pre>

                <p>Above, we have records for three plates.  Each record can hold as many key-value pairs as needed, and they can even be nested to provide additional context.  For example:</p>

                <pre>{
"identifier": "mc493",
    "repository": "DASCH",
    "plate_info": {
        "series": "mc",
        "number": "493",
        "plate_class": "L"
    }
}</pre>

                <p>The "series", "number", and "plate_class" keys are nested under the key "plate_info".</p>

                <p>Most importantly, records in a noSQL database do not have to have the same fields across all records.  It’s valuable to have some common fields, and some common data structure, but data found in one record does not have to also exist in another.  New records added to a noSQL database can contain fields that older records do not.  Likewise the new records can leave out fields that are included in the older records.</p>

                <p>That being said, it is still useful to have some general overall structure for the data in a noSQL database to facilitate searching.  Below are the types of information that are required and recommended for inclusion in the Glass Plates Inventory database:</p>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-12 col-md-4">

                <p>Content stored in the Glass Plates Inventory database is organized into three categories: information about the plate itself, information about the observatory and instrument that took the plate, and information about the exposures. All data except the record id (auto generated), the plate identifier, and archive should be included in one of those three categories.</p>

                <p>Following this organizational structure, while not strictly required, facilitates the display of information throughout the Glass Plates Inventory website, as well as increasing searchability and findability.</p>

                <p>More specific information about how glass plate records are organized for this site can be found in the section below.</p>

                <br/>
                <a name="add" class="anchor"></a>
                <h2>Add Your Archive</h2>
                <br/>
                
                <p>The Glass Plates Inventory site uses a noSQL database to store astronomical photographic glass plates records.  A noSQL database is a collection of JSON documents.  An introduction to noSQL databases and how they compare to SQL databases can be in the section above.</p>

                <p>There are two main document stores used by the Glass Plates Inventory:
                <ul>
                    <li>Records that describe archives</li>
                    <li>Records that describe glass plates</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Each of these record types contain a mix of required and recommended fields, with a set structure.  The GPI would expect to receive a single Archive Record to describe the archive, and then a separate JSON record for each plate in the collection.</p>

                <h3>Archive Records</h3>
                
                <p>These are fairly simple documents that provide the name of an archive, an identifier for the archive, a url, a description, and a list of interesting / unique glass plate fields.  All but the last item are required fields for Archive Records.  The list of unique glass plate fields will be used to augment archive specific search pages, though some of that information may also be searchable from the main GPI search pages as well.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>_id - the database record id, this field is auto generated when a new record is added to the noSQL store</li>
                    <li>identifier - a short nickname, one word or acronym with no spaces, to identify the archive</li>
                    <li>name - the full name of the archive written out</li>
                    <li>url - the URL for the archive or observatory’s main website</li>
                    <li>desc - a short description, 3-4 sentences, about the archive</li>
                    <li>fields - a list of interesting fields found in the glass plate records for items in this archive and form types for each field</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Glass Plate Records</h3>
                
                <p>These records describe individual plates to varying degrees of detail and they are the main feature of the Glass Plates Inventory.  There are only two absolutely required fields in a glass plate record, though three additional fields are very strongly recommended, and three more are recommended.</p>

                <h4>General Fields</h4>

                <p>The first three general fields are all required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>_id - the database record id, this field is autogenerated when a new record is added to the noSQL store</li>
                    <li>identifier - the plate identifier used within the archive, how it is uniquely identified within its own archive, this does NOT need to unique between archives</li>
                    <li>archive - the archive identifier, must correspond to the identifier in the Archive Record that accompanies the Glass Plate Records</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After those, the rest of these records can be very different from plate to plate, depending on the information available, and are organized into three main categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Information about the plate</li>
                    <li>Information about the observatory</li>
                    <li>Information about the photographic exposures</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Plate Information</h4>
                
                <p>There are no required fields under this category, but there are some fields currently in use in the database which might be useful to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>multi - number of exposures taken on the plate, only needed if each exposure is not detailed individually (see Exposure Information)</li>
                    <li>emulsion - the photographic emulsion used on the plate</li>
                    <li>filter - the filter used on this photographic plate</li>
                    <li>band - the spectral band this plate has captured</li>
                    <li>type - direct or spectral plate</li>
                    <li>observer - the name of the astronomer who took the plate</li>
                    <li>notes - general free text notes about the plate</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Other fields as determined by your archive can be added as well, the main thing to consider is that this information should be generalizable about the actual photographic glass plate itself.  These might include notes about plate availability or digitization status, or information about the dimensions of the plate. This could also be the place to add information about plate series or sub collections within the archive.</p>

                <h4>Observatory Information</h4>
                <p>There are <u>no required fields</u> under this category, but there are some fields currently in use in the database which might be useful to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>observatory - the name of the observatory this plate was taken</li>
                    <li>instrument / telescope - the name of the instrument or telescope used to take this plate</li>
                    <li>longitude / latitude - the location of the telescope or observatory</li>
                    <li>notes - general free text notes about the observatory</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Other fields as determined by your archive can be added as well, the main thing to consider is that this information should be generalizable about the observatory where the photographic glass plate was exposed and the instruments used.  These might include information about the telescope aperture or textual information describing the location of the observatory.</p>

                <h4>Exposure Information</h4>
                <p>Other than the identifier and the archive this is the most important part of a glass plate record.   Unlike the other categories, this section is organized into a list.</p>

                <p>The intention is that each exposure would have its own list entry if possible.  If multiple exposures are present on a plate, but detailed information about each exposure is not available, but the plate has multiple exposures, it is recommended that the archive use the “multi” field under “Plate Information” to at least provide the number of exposures.  If the multiple exposures are present on the plate, and details of each are known, then that information is shared in this section.</p>

                <p>This section contains some very strongly recommended (almost required) fields, along with other recommended fields, as other fields current in use in the database that might be useful to consider for each exposure:</p>

                <h5>Very Strongly Recommended</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>number - which number exposure on the plate is the one currently described</li>
                    <li>ra - the right ascension at the center of the plate, can be in h:m:s or decimal degrees, or whichever format is most preferred by the archive</li>
                    <li>ra_deg - if the ra field exists, then this field must also exist.  It contains the right ascension at the center of the plate and in decimal degrees</li>
                    <li>dec - the declination at the center of the plate, can be in degrees, minutes, seconds, or decimal degrees, whichever format is most preferred by the archive</li>
                    <li>dec_deg - if the dec field exists, then this field must also exist.  It contains the declination at the center of the plate and in decimal degrees</li>
                    <li>jd2000 - the julian date as JD2000 for the exposure</li>
                    <li>duration - the duration of the exposure, in whatever unit your archive prefers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Other fields as determined by your archive can be added as well, the main thing to consider is that this information should be about a specific exposure on the photographic glass plate.  This might include notes about the weather when the plate was exposed or the target the plate was intended to photograph.</p>

            The stars photographed on glass plates between 1880s-1990s operate
            as time capsules, allowing astronomers to study how the sky has
            changed over one hundred years.",
